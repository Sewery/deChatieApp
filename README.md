# deChatieApp

It is my desktop app communicator. It uses ENet and SDL library. It's writeen in C++ ( if you see many other languages it's due to dependencies which I use )
App is in early stage of development. If you see any bugs please report to issues

This app is at this moment capable of launching server  and sevral client on local host sending accross it messages. UI also is basic.
I'm plannig to develeop this app in following weeks

## How to complie?
It's fairly easy. If you MS Visual Studio you can open sln file and bulid. Otherwise I uploded all dependecies and placed dlls in seprate folder.

Every picture, music or font is downloaded from internet and it's not my property
